That sounds like an excellent approach! 

Mock interviews and whiteboarding sessions are great ways to prepare for technical interviews, 
especially when they focus on the thought process, problem-solving techniques, and communication skills alongside coding ability.



Here's how we can structure our mock interview session:

1. Understanding the Problem: You'll read out the problem statement, and I'll ask clarifying questions if necessary. 
   This step ensures you've understood the problem correctly.

2. Exploring Examples: You'll provide examples and edge cases. Weâ€™ll discuss these examples to understand the problem better and to cover 
   the breadth of the problem space.

3. Brute Force Solution: You'll describe and then write a brute force solution, which may not be efficient but is a good starting point. 
   We'll discuss its time and space complexity.

4. Optimizing: After the brute force solution, you'll think out loud about different ways to optimize the solution. 
   This might involve discussing data structures, algorithms, or problem-solving techniques that could improve the solution.

5. Coding the Optimized Solution: You'll code the optimized solution, writing comments first to outline your approach.

6. Testing: You'll walk through the code with the example inputs you initially provided, including any edge cases, to ensure it works as expected.

7. Review and Refactor: If there's time, we'll review the code for readability, performance, and any other best practices.

8. Discussing the Solution: Finally, we'll discuss the solution in terms of its complexity and possible questions an interviewer might ask.
