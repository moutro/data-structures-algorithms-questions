// can buitd queues with arrays or linked lists

// why would stacks or queues benefit or not by building them with arrays or linked lists?
// arrays are faster for stacks
// linked lists are faster for queues - never want to build it with an array because you have to shift everything over Head and Tail
// arrays are faster for stacks because they are contiguous in memory but linked lists are also okay
// linked lists are faster for queues because they are not contiguous in memory
